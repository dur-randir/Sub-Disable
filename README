NAME
    Sub::Disable - remove function/method call from the compiled code

SYNOPSIS
        use Sub::Disable 'debug', 'foo', 'bar'; # without specification - both method + sub form calls

        use Sub::Disable method => ['debug'];
        use Sub::Disable sub    => ['debug'];
        use Sub::Disable {
            method => ['foo'],
            sub    => ['bar'],
        };

        sub debug { warn "DEBUG INFO: @_" }

        __PACKAGE__->debug(some_heave_debug()); # no-op
        debug(even_more(), heavier_debug()); # no-op

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to turn compile-time resolvable function or
    method call into no-op (together with all arguments computation). This
    is useful for debugging and/or logging, when you don't want to make your
    production code slower.

    Note that 'compile-time resolvable method call' is a method call on a
    literal package name

        __PACKAGE__->method
        # or
        Some::Package->method

    and does not consider inheritance.

    Sub::Disable distinguishes between sub and method calls and, by default,
    removes both of them. If you want to remove only one type - use
    appropriate form of import.

CAVEATS
    Sub::Disable will remove only those sub/method calls that were compiled
    after you have use'd it.

    If you use Sub::Disable together with namespace::clean and you want to
    remove some function as a sub call, but not as a method call, you should
    use Sub::Disable after using namespace::clean or exclude that method
    with '-except'.
